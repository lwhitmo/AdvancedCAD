## CAD_PullCopter

### Description
The pull copter is meant to create a ring on which you can put a spinner that will fly into the air when gears are activiated.

## Ring


### Description

The first assignment is to create the ring. The dimensions of the top face of are the same of those of the top. A circle is added for the ring and is added to the top of the ring.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* the use tool(which takes the dimensions from anything)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Key

### Description
the key engages the gears in the spinner and will propell the spinner off

### Reflection
In the key, i learned how to use:
* linear pattern
* It is also important to remember to check how many indents you want or else it might to far into the ring for the puller
* limits on a slider

## CAD_SwingArm

### Description
For this assignment we were tasked to create a part with very few direct dimensions, the intent of the assignment to prepare for the onshape certification test where we will be given simmilar task. One of the more interesting aspects of this assighnment is the constraints which in combination with a few dimensions created a very clean and well designed part. The next step of this assignment was to change some dimensions to expose the weaknesses in your constraints.

### Reflection

In this assignment, the most important factor is to make constrints befor you dimension the object. If you do not do this, it will lead to a sketch that is locke in place, and not in a good way. 

## CAD_MultiPartStudio

### Description
The intent of this assignment, much like the swing arm was to prepare us for the onshape certification test. The goal of this assignment being to prepare for the multi-part studio aspect of the certification test. This specific practice was to model a vaccum pump, using a singular part studio. Similarlly to the swing arm, there were multiple steps/dimension changes to expose different waknesses/flaws in our design.

### Reflection
One thing that i learned from this assignment was the importance of section view. When making the top cap, i struggled with making a sketch on the front plane and revolving it around the circle. Also, when using the section veiw, you have to make sure you have a construction line to base the sketch off of or there will be no spot to draw the sketch. The last thing that i struggled with was making the plunger. I thought that the best way to make it was to repeat the method of using the section view. I found that it was much easier to make a plane 15mm below the top of the plunger and extrude up.
