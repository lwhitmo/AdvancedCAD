### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* the use tool(which takes the dimensions from anything)
* 

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.
